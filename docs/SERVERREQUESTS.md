# Serverrequests

Serverrequests are requests fom the client to the server. They are the equivalent of the commands from the server to the client. They get executed on the server.

Currently, there is only the PullCommandRequest, which is used to pull new commands from the server by addressing the server operations manager.
Please refer to the [PullCommandRequest](../theoden/operations/serverrequests/pull.py) for more information.
